    "\n",
    "Need to maintain 3.6V maximum from ESP32 and other downstream chips, but lithium batteries can have up to 4.2V, and PMID will regulate to 4.5V when charging. Connecting directly to components would damage chips, but the built-in LDO in the TLV758P can only handle 150mA, too low for the ESP32-S2 when using WiFi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulating to 3.6V is preferred over 3.3V, since this will allow the headphone amp in the SGTL5000 to drive higher-impedance headphones, and with more power. The LDO is expected to operate in dropout for significant periods, acting as a \"maximum voltage limit\" more than a traditional voltage regulator. For this reason, low dropout voltage is beneficial. It also means a requirement for an adjustible voltage regulator, since there are no 3.6V preset LDOs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TLV758P was chosen for it's low dropout voltage (<100mV typ at 3.3V+), low cost, small size, and low package thermal resistance (it has a power ground pad).\n",
